# Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Description

This project implements and explores **different Machine Learning models** using Python. Its main objective is to analyze data, train statistical models, and interpret the results obtained.

The work is presented in the form of a **Jupyter Notebook**, allowing a step-by-step approach that includes data preparation, modeling, training, and analysis.
